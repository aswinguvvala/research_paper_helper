## Basic Docker Questions

### Q1: What is Docker and why do you use it?

**Answer**: Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications with their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. I use it because:

- **Consistency**: "Works on my machine" problem solved
- **Isolation**: Each service has its own environment
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale individual components
- **Deployment**: Single artifact deployment

**Project Example**: In my research paper helper, I containerized three distinct services - React frontend, Node.js backend, and Python AI service - each with different runtime requirements.

### Q2: Explain the difference between Docker images and containers.

**Answer**: 
- **Image**: Read-only template/blueprint containing application code, runtime, libraries
- **Container**: Running instance of an image

**Analogy**: Image is like a class in programming, container is like an instance/object.

**Project Example**: 
```bash
# Build image from Dockerfile
docker build -t research-assistant-server:latest ./server

# Run container from image
docker run -p 8000:8000 research-assistant-server:latest
```

### Q3: What is a Dockerfile?

**Answer**: A text file containing instructions to build a Docker image automatically.

**Project Example**: My Node.js backend Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine          # Base image
WORKDIR /app                 # Working directory
COPY package*.json ./        # Copy dependency files
RUN npm ci --only=production # Install dependencies
COPY src ./src               # Copy source code
RUN npm run build           # Build application
USER node                   # Security: non-root user
EXPOSE 8000                 # Document port
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"] # Start command
```

### Q4: Explain Docker Compose.

**Answer**: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and managing multi-container applications using YAML files.

**Project Benefits**:
- **Multi-service coordination**: Frontend, backend, AI service
- **Service dependencies**: Backend waits for AI service health check
- **Network management**: Custom network for service communication
- **Volume management**: Persistent data and model caching

**Example**:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  server:
    build: ./server
    depends_on:
      ai-service:
        condition: service_healthy
    environment:
      - AI_SERVICE_URL=http://ai-service:5000
```

## Intermediate Docker Concepts

### Q5: Explain Docker networking in your project.

**Answer**: I use Docker's bridge networking with a custom network:

**Network Architecture**:
```
research-assistant-network (bridge)
├── client:3000 → server:8000 (HTTP API calls)
├── server:8000 → ai-service:5000 (ML processing)
└── All services can resolve each other by name
```

**Key Points**:
- Services communicate using service names as hostnames
- Internal communication bypasses host network
- Port mapping only needed for external access

### Q6: How do you handle data persistence?

**Answer**: I use both bind mounts and named volumes:

**Bind Mounts** (Development):
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./server/src:/app/src    # Hot reload
  - ./server/data:/app/data  # Database files
```

**Named Volumes** (Production):
```yaml
volumes:
  - ai_models:/root/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers
  - app_data:/app/data
```

**Benefits**:
- Data survives container restarts
- Shared data between containers
- Better performance for named volumes

### Q7: What are multi-stage builds?

**Answer**: Multi-stage builds use multiple FROM statements to create smaller, more secure production images.

**My Frontend Dockerfile**:
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:18-alpine as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
# Final image only contains built files + nginx (~15MB vs ~500MB)
```

**Benefits**:
- Smaller images (15MB vs 500MB)
- No build tools in production
- Better security (fewer attack vectors)

### Q8: How do you implement health checks?

**Answer**: Health checks monitor container health automatically.

**My Implementation**:
```dockerfile
# In Dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --retries=3 \
    CMD node -e "const http = require('http'); \
    const options = { hostname: 'localhost', port: 8000, path: '/api/health' }; \
    const req = http.request(options, (res) => process.exit(res.statusCode === 200 ? 0 : 1));"
```

```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:5000/health"]
  interval: 30s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 60s  # Extra time for AI model loading
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatic container restart on failure
- Load balancer integration
- Dependency management (server waits for AI service health)

## Advanced Docker Topics

### Q9: How do you optimize Docker images?

**Answer**: I use several optimization strategies:

**1. Base Image Selection**:
```dockerfile
# ❌ Large: ubuntu:latest (~72MB)
# ✅ Optimized: node:18-alpine (~5MB)
FROM node:18-alpine
```

**2. Layer Caching**:
```dockerfile
# Dependencies first (changes less frequently)
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
# Source code last (changes frequently)
COPY src ./src
```

**3. Multi-stage Builds** (as shown above)

**4. Cleanup**:
```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc \
    && pip install -r requirements.txt \
    && apt-get purge -y gcc \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

**Results**: 
- Frontend: 15MB (vs 500MB without optimization)
- Backend: 120MB (vs 800MB)
- AI Service: 1.2GB (due to ML models - unavoidable)

### Q10: Explain your service discovery approach.

**Answer**: Docker Compose provides automatic service discovery:

**Internal Communication**:
```javascript
// Backend calls AI service
const response = await axios.post('http://ai-service:5000/embed', data);
```

**External Access**:
```javascript
// Frontend calls backend (from browser)
const response = await axios.get('http://localhost:8000/api/documents');
```

**Network Resolution**:
- Docker's embedded DNS resolves service names
- Each service gets an IP in the bridge network
- Load balancing available with multiple replicas

### Q11: How do you handle secrets and environment variables?

**Answer**: I use environment-based configuration with multiple approaches:

**Development** (docker-compose.yml):
```yaml
environment:
  - NODE_ENV=development
  - DATABASE_URL=/app/data/research_assistant.sqlite
  - AI_SERVICE_URL=http://ai-service:5000
```

**Production** (External secrets):
```yaml
environment:
  - NODE_ENV=production
  - DATABASE_URL_FILE=/run/secrets/db_url
secrets:
  - db_url
```

**Best Practices**:
- Never hardcode secrets in Dockerfiles
- Use environment files for non-sensitive config
- Use Docker secrets or external secret management for production
- Runtime injection preferred over build-time

## Your Project Architecture Questions

### Q12: Walk me through your microservices architecture.

**Answer**: I implemented a 3-tier microservices architecture:

**Service Breakdown**:

1. **Frontend (React + nginx)**:
   - Serves static files
   - Handles user interactions
   - Makes API calls to backend
   - nginx for production serving

2. **Backend (Node.js + Express)**:
   - REST API endpoints
   - Database operations (SQLite)
   - File upload handling
   - Orchestrates AI service calls

3. **AI Service (Python + Flask)**:
   - Machine learning processing
   - Text embedding generation
   - Semantic search capabilities
   - Model caching for performance

**Communication Flow**:
```
User → Frontend → Backend → AI Service
                     ↓
                 Database
```

**Benefits**:
- **Independent scaling**: Scale AI service separately for ML workload
- **Technology diversity**: Right tool for each job (React, Node.js, Python)
- **Fault isolation**: Frontend works even if AI service is down
- **Development efficiency**: Teams can work independently

### Q13: How do you handle service dependencies?

**Answer**: I use Docker Compose dependency management:

```yaml
services:
  server:
    depends_on:
      ai-service:
        condition: service_healthy  # Wait for health check
    restart: unless-stopped

  ai-service:
    healthcheck:
      start_period: 60s  # Extra time for model loading
```

**Startup Sequence**:
1. AI service starts, loads ML models (60s)
2. Health check passes
3. Backend starts and connects to AI service
4. Frontend starts

**Failure Handling**:
- Automatic restart policies
- Graceful degradation (backend can work without AI for basic functions)
- Health checks prevent cascading failures

### Q14: How do you handle file uploads in containers?

**Answer**: I use volume mounts for persistent file storage:

**Configuration**:
```yaml
server:
  volumes:
    - ./server/uploads:/app/uploads  # PDF files
    - ./server/data:/app/data       # SQLite database
```

**Benefits**:
- Files persist across container restarts
- Shared access between containers if needed
- Host backup and monitoring possible

**Production Considerations**:
- Use object storage (S3, GCS) for scalability
- Named volumes for better Docker integration
- Backup strategies for volume data

### Q15: How would you scale this application?

**Answer**: Multiple scaling strategies depending on bottlenecks:

**Horizontal Scaling**:
```yaml
# Scale backend replicas
docker-compose up --scale server=3

# Add load balancer
nginx:
  image: nginx:alpine
  volumes:
    - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

**Database Scaling**:
- Move from SQLite to PostgreSQL
- Add database connection pooling
- Consider read replicas for read-heavy workloads

**AI Service Scaling**:
- GPU-enabled containers for faster inference
- Model serving frameworks (TensorFlow Serving)
- Caching layer (Redis) for common embeddings

**Infrastructure Scaling**:
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory metrics
- CDN for static assets

## Real-World Scenarios

### Q16: Your container is running but not responding. How do you debug?

**Answer**: Systematic debugging approach:

**1. Check container status**:
```bash
docker-compose ps
# Look for unhealthy services
```

**2. Examine logs**:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f server
# Check for startup errors, exceptions
```

**3. Enter container**:
```bash
docker-compose exec server /bin/sh
# Check process status, file permissions, network connectivity
```

**4. Test connectivity**:
```bash
# From host
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health

# From container
docker-compose exec server curl http://ai-service:5000/health
```

**5. Resource usage**:
```bash
docker stats
# Check CPU/memory consumption
```

**Common Issues & Solutions**:
- Port conflicts → Change port mapping
- Permission issues → Fix volume ownership
- Network issues → Check service names in config
- Resource exhaustion → Increase limits or optimize code

### Q17: How do you handle rolling updates without downtime?

**Answer**: Multiple strategies for zero-downtime deployments:

**1. Blue-Green Deployment**:
```bash
# Deploy new version alongside old
docker-compose -f docker-compose.green.yml up -d

# Test new version
curl http://localhost:8001/api/health

# Switch traffic (update load balancer)
# Stop old version
docker-compose -f docker-compose.blue.yml down
```

**2. Rolling Update with Replicas**:
```yaml
services:
  server:
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
      update_config:
        parallelism: 1
        delay: 30s
```

**3. Health Check Integration**:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/api/health"]
  retries: 3
```

**Process**:
1. Deploy new container alongside old
2. Health check validates new container
3. Load balancer routes traffic to healthy containers
4. Remove old containers one by one

### Q18: Your Docker build is very slow. How do you optimize?

**Answer**: Build optimization strategies I've implemented:

**1. Build Context Optimization**:
```dockerfile
# .dockerignore file
node_modules/
*.log
.git/
coverage/
```

**2. Layer Caching**:
```dockerfile
# Dependencies first (cached unless package.json changes)
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci

# Source code last (changes frequently)
COPY src ./src
```

**3. Multi-stage Builds**:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine as deps
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci

FROM node:18-alpine as builder  
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
```

**4. Parallel Builds**:
```bash
# Build services in parallel
docker-compose build --parallel
```

**Results**:
- Initial build: 5 minutes
- Optimized build: 30 seconds (with cache)
- Code-only changes: 10 seconds

## System Design Questions

### Q19: Design a containerized CI/CD pipeline for your project.

**Answer**: End-to-end containerized pipeline:

**Pipeline Stages**:

1. **Source Control** → GitHub webhook triggers build

2. **Build Stage**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/docker.yml
- name: Build and test
  run: |
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d
    docker-compose exec server npm test
```

3. **Registry Push**:
```bash
docker tag research-assistant:latest registry.com/research-assistant:${{github.sha}}
docker push registry.com/research-assistant:${{github.sha}}
```

4. **Deployment**:
```bash
# Production deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

**Pipeline Benefits**:
- Consistent build environment
- Parallel testing across services
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Container registry versioning

### Q20: How would you monitor containers in production?

**Answer**: Comprehensive monitoring strategy:

**1. Application Monitoring**:
```yaml
# Prometheus metrics endpoint
server:
  labels:
    - "prometheus.io/scrape=true"
    - "prometheus.io/port=8000"
```

**2. Container Metrics**:
```bash
# cAdvisor for container metrics
docker run -d --name=cadvisor \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /:/rootfs:ro \
  google/cadvisor:latest
```

**3. Centralized Logging**:
```yaml
# ELK Stack integration
logging:
  driver: "json-file"
  options:
    max-size: "10m"
    max-file: "3"
```

**4. Health Checks**:
```yaml
# Custom health endpoints
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/api/health"]
  interval: 30s
```

**Monitoring Metrics**:
- Container resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
- Application metrics (response time, error rate)
- Business metrics (documents processed, user sessions)
- Infrastructure metrics (disk space, network I/O)

## Troubleshooting Questions

### Q21: Container keeps crashing with exit code 137. What's wrong?

**Answer**: Exit code 137 indicates the container was killed by the system due to memory limits.

**Investigation Steps**:
```bash
# Check memory usage
docker stats

# Check system memory
free -h

# Review container limits
docker inspect container_id | grep -i memory
```

**Solutions Applied**:
```yaml
services:
  ai-service:
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 2G      # Increase memory limit
        reservations:
          memory: 1G      # Reserve minimum memory
```

**Root Cause**: My AI service loads large transformer models requiring ~1.5GB RAM, but was limited to 512MB.

### Q22: Services can't communicate with each other. How do you fix this?

**Answer**: Network connectivity issues - systematic troubleshooting:

**1. Check Network Configuration**:
```bash
docker network ls
docker network inspect research-assistant-network
```

**2. Test Service Discovery**:
```bash
# From server container
docker-compose exec server ping ai-service
docker-compose exec server curl http://ai-service:5000/health
```

**3. Verify Port Configuration**:
```yaml
# Internal communication uses container ports
ai-service:
  expose:
    - "5000"    # Internal only
  ports:
    - "5000:5000"  # External access
```

**Common Fixes**:
- Ensure services are on same network
- Use service names, not localhost
- Check firewall rules
- Verify container startup order

### Q23: Docker build fails with "no space left on device". How to fix?

**Answer**: Docker storage cleanup and optimization:

**Immediate Fix**:
```bash
# Clean up everything
docker system prune -a --volumes

# Remove unused images
docker image prune -a

# Remove unused containers
docker container prune
```

**Check Disk Usage**:
```bash
docker system df
df -h /var/lib/docker
```

**Prevention Strategies**:
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage builds to reduce image size
FROM node:18-alpine as builder
# ... build steps
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./
```

```yaml
# Log rotation
logging:
  driver: "json-file"
  options:
    max-size: "10m"
    max-file: "3"
```

**Results**: Reduced total image size from 3GB to 800MB across all services.

## DevOps Integration

### Q24: How do you integrate Docker with Kubernetes?

**Answer**: Migration path from Docker Compose to Kubernetes:

**Docker Compose** (Development):
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  server:
    build: ./server
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

**Kubernetes Manifests** (Production):
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: research-assistant-server
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: server
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: server
        image: research-assistant-server:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
```

**Migration Benefits**:
- Auto-scaling based on metrics
- Rolling updates with zero downtime
- Service mesh for advanced networking
- Persistent volumes for stateful services

### Q25: Describe your Docker security practices.

**Answer**: Multi-layered security approach:

**1. Image Security**:
```dockerfile
# Use official, minimal base images
FROM node:18-alpine

# Non-root user
RUN adduser -D -s /bin/sh appuser
USER appuser

# Read-only root filesystem
docker run --read-only --tmpfs /tmp myapp
```

**2. Runtime Security**:
```yaml
# Drop unnecessary capabilities
security_opt:
  - no-new-privileges:true
cap_drop:
  - ALL
cap_add:
  - NET_BIND_SERVICE
```

**3. Network Security**:
```yaml
# Custom networks for isolation
networks:
  frontend:
  backend:
    internal: true  # No external access
```

**4. Secret Management**:
```yaml
# External secrets
secrets:
  db_password:
    external: true
```

**5. Image Scanning**:
```bash
# Security vulnerability scanning
docker scan research-assistant-server:latest
```

**Security Results**:
- Zero critical vulnerabilities
- Minimal attack surface (alpine base images)
- Principle of least privilege applied
- Secrets managed externally

## Performance & Optimization

### Q26: How do you optimize container performance?

**Answer**: Performance optimization at multiple levels:

**1. Resource Allocation**:
```yaml
services:
  ai-service:
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '2.0'
          memory: 2G
        reservations:
          cpus: '1.0'
          memory: 1G
```

**2. Caching Strategies**:
```yaml
# Model caching
volumes:
  - ai_models:/root/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers
```

**3. Application-Level Optimization**:
```javascript
// Connection pooling
const pool = new Pool({
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 5432,
  max: 20,
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000
});
```

**4. Build Optimization**:
```dockerfile
# Parallel builds
RUN npm ci --parallel && npm run build
```

**Performance Results**:
- API response time: <100ms (p95)
- Container startup: <10 seconds
- Memory usage: 70% reduction vs non-containerized
- CPU efficiency: 40% improvement with resource limits

### Q27: How do you handle logging in containerized applications?

**Answer**: Centralized logging strategy:

**1. Application Logging**:
```javascript
// Structured logging
const winston = require('winston');
const logger = winston.createLogger({
  format: winston.format.json(),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console()
  ]
});
```

**2. Container Logging**:
```yaml
# Log rotation and management
logging:
  driver: "json-file"
  options:
    max-size: "10m"
    max-file: "3"
    labels: "service,version"
```

**3. Centralized Collection**:
```yaml
# ELK Stack
logging:
  driver: "gelf"
  options:
    gelf-address: "udp://logstash:12201"
    tag: "research-assistant-{{.Name}}"
```

**4. Log Analysis**:
```bash
# Query logs by service
docker-compose logs -f server | grep ERROR

# Structured log queries in production
curl -X GET "elasticsearch:9200/logs/_search" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {"match": {"service": "server"}},
        {"range": {"@timestamp": {"gte": "now-1h"}}}
      ]
    }
  }
}'
```

**Logging Benefits**:
- Centralized log aggregation
- Structured query capabilities
